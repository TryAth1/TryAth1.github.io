# FRM Ⅰ BOOK1  RISK MANAGEMENT：A Helicopter View

## 1.1 Exam Focus

- Understanding the general risk management risk and its potential shortings
- The concept of unexpected loss,relationship between risk and reward

## 1.2 The Concept of Risk

[ To Conclude ] : Uncertainty

- the more important  concern : variability of the loss

[ Risk Management ] : aimed to reduce or eliminate an entity's potential to incur expected losses

[ Risk Taking ] :  incremental risk in order to generate incremental gains,can be thought of an opportunitistic  context

## 1.3 The Risk Management Process

[ Aim ] : describe the risk management process and identify problems and challenges that can arise in the risk management process

[Two Key problems ] : identify the  correct risks + find an efficient method of transferring the risk

[ Challenges in ensuring that risk management is good to the economy ] :

- risk must be sufficiently dispersed among willing and able participants in the economy
- failed to consistently assist in preventing  market disruptions or preventing financial account fraud 
- use of derivatives as complex trading strategies assisted in overstating the financial position of many entities and understating the level of risk assumed by many entities

【Conclusion 】 : risk management can be thought of as a zero-sum  game,risk transferring by one party and assuming by another party.

## 1.4 Measuring and Managing Risk

[ Tools ] : quantiative measures,qualitative assessment,and enterprise risk mangement 

[ QUantiative Measures ] : Value at Risk (VaR)

About 5% Probablity of Loss  higher than -15.50%,if you have $1,000,000 invested in this security,the one-month VaR is  <u>1,000,000*-15.5%=155,000</u>

[ Economic capital ] : holding efficient liquid reserves to cover a potential loss. 

**eg**: if one-day VaR=2.5 million, and the entity holds 2.5million liquid reserves,then it is unlikely to go bankrupt that day

[Qualitative Assessment ] : 

- Scenario analysis 
- Stress testing

[ Enterprise Risk Management ] : considers entity-wide risks and tries to integrate risk considerations into key business decisions

## 1.5 Expected and Unexpected Loss

[ Aims ] : Distinguish between expected loss and unexpected loss(with correlation risks)

## 1.6 Risk AND Reward

measurable -> risk

unmeasuable -> uncertainty

risk tolerances are high -> the spread between riskless and risky bonds may narrow to an abnormally low level --> disguise the true relationship between risk and return

[ non-publicly traded securities ] : the price is less reliable 

[ with management bonus ] : intend to result in higher reported profit

## 1.7 Risk Classes

[ Aims ] : describe and differentiate between the key classes of risks,explain how arise ,and asses the impact on an organization

**Market risk** :

- interest rate risk -> consider a bond earning a fixed rate of interest
- equity price risk 
- - general market risk (can not be diversified)
  - specific risk 
- foreign exchange risk 
- commodity price risk

**Credit risk** :

- default risk
- bankruptcy risk
- - liquidation value of the collateral is insufficient to recover the full loss on default
- downgrade risk 降级风险
- settlement risk 结算风险
- - using a derivatives transaction between two counterparties.At settlement date,the position that is losing may simply refuse to pay and fulfill its obligations

If the losing party defaults,the winning party may lose some or all of that net gain

[ Recovery value ] :

[ Loss given defult ] :LGD

**eg**: if a party's net gain position is 500,000 at settlement and only 400,000 is expected to be recovered,

Recovery value = 400,000

LGD = 100,000

Recovery rate = 80%

LGD = 20%

**Liquidity Risk** :

- funding liquidity risk
- trading liquidiy risk

**Operational Risk**:

**Legal and Regulatory Risk**:

**Business Risk**:

**Strategic Risk**

**Reputation Risk**
