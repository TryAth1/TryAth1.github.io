# CFA Level Ⅰ - Portfolio Management (7%)

[TOC]

## 1. Portfolio Management:An Overview

### 1.1 Exam Focus

- The portfolio management process
- The investment policy statement
- Learn the investment needs of different types of investors 
- Learn the different kinds of pooled investments

## 1.2 Portfolio Perspective

*Evaluating individual investments by their contribution to **the risk and return** of an investor's portfolio*

#### 1.2.1 Diversification

Allows an investor to reduce the risk of the investment without necessarily reducing the portfolio's return

#### 1.2.2 Measure Of The Benefits of Diversification

[ Diversification Ratio ] :

- Calculated as the ratio of the risk of an equally weighted portfolio of n securities(measured by its standard deviation of returns ) to the risk of a single security selected as random from the n securities 
- - for example: If the average standard deviation of returns for the n stocks is 25%,and the standard deviation of returns for the n stocks is 18%,**the diversification ratio = 18/25 =0.72**

### 1.3 Different Types Of Investors And Distinctive Charactertistics And Needs Of Each

### 1.4 Defined Contribution Pension Plan

[ Description ] : 

- a retirement plan in which the firm contributes a sum each period  to the employee's retirement account

### 1.5 The Portfolio Management Process

[ Three major steps ] :

- Planning step
- - analysis of the investor's risk tolerance,return objectives,time horizon,tax exposure,liquidity needs,income needs,and any unique circumstances or investor preferences
  - results in an **investment policy statement (IPS)** that details the investor's investment objectives and contraints 
  - - specify an objective benchmark
- Execution step
- - analysis of the risk and return charactertistics of various asset classes to determine how funds will be allocated to the various asset types
  - Once the asset class allocations are determined,portfolio managers may attempt to identify the most attractive securities within the asset class
- Feedback step
- - monitor these changes and rebalance the portfolio periodically
  - adjust the allocations to the various assets classes back to their desired percentages
  - measure portfolio performance and evaluate it relative to the return on the benchmark portfolio identified in the **IPS**

------

### 1.6 Various Types Of Funds

- Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
- Open-end funds(开放式基金):**lower brokerage costs**
- Closed-end funds(封闭式基金)
- Mutual funds
- - Money market funds
  - Bond mutual funds
- Hedge funds
- Buyout funds(并购基金)
- Venture capital funds
- A seperately managed account

------

## 2. Portfolio Risk And Return:Part Ⅰ

### 2.1 Exam Focus

- Understanding the historical return and risk rankings of the major asset classes
- Understanding how the correlation(covariance) of returns between asstes and between various assets classes
- Risk aversion

## 2.2 Cacluation Of Return

### 2.2.1 Holding Period Return(HPY)

![](http://oam2zfeyb.bkt.clouddn.com/CFA-27.png)

### 2.2.2 Average  Returns

- Arithmetic mean return
- Geometric mean return
- Money-weighted rate of return

### 2.2.3 Other Return Measures

- Gross return
- Pretax nominal return
- After-tax nominal return
- Real return
- - Adjusted for inflation
- Leveraged return

### 2.3 Risk

#### 2.3.1 Variance of Returns for an Individual Security

![](http://oam2zfeyb.bkt.clouddn.com/CFA-28.png)

*Sample variance*:

#### 2.3.2 Covariance And Correlation of Reuturns for Two Securities

![](http://oam2zfeyb.bkt.clouddn.com/CFA-30.png)

![](http://oam2zfeyb.bkt.clouddn.com/CFA-31.png)

### 2.4 Different types of Investors

[ Risk Aversion ] : <u>dislike risk</u>

[ Risk-seeking ] : <u>prefer more risk</u>

[ Risk-neutral] : <u>no preferences</u>

### 2.5 Portfolio Management

#### 2.5.1 Covariance

![](http://oam2zfeyb.bkt.clouddn.com/CFA-32.png)



#### 2.5.2 Minimun-variance and Efficient Frontiers

- Minimum-variance portfolios - make up the minimum-variance frontier
- - have the lowest standard deviation of all portfolios with a given expected return
- Efficient Frontiers 
- - have the greatest return for each level of risk 
  - - on the efficient frontiers that has the least risk is the global minimum-variance portfolio

#### 2.5.3 Indifference curve

*combinations of risk and expected return among which an investor is indifferent*

#### 2.5.3 Capital Allocation Line

*Combinations of risk assets and risk-free assets*

The crossover between Indifference curve and capital allocation line is the optimal portfolio for a certain investor.

Line above the Capital alloation line is unreachable.

## 3. Portfolio Risk And Return:Part Ⅱ

### 3.1 Exam Focus

- CAL and CML
- Total risk
- Calculating β
- CAPM and SML
- Measuring the performance of a portfolio

### 3.2 CAL and CML

#### 3.2.1 Concept of CML

<u>Under the assumption of homogeneous expections</u>:

(they all have thr same estimates of risk,return and correlations with other risky assets for all risky assets)

- all investors face the same efficient frontier of risky portfolios and will have the same optimal risky portfolio and CAL

只有与有效边界相切的那条才是CML。不同的无风险资产和无风险资产组合有无数条，统称为CAL，CML是CAL中的特例，也是理论上最优的一条。资本市场线是无风险资产和市场组合的组织，资本配置线是无风险资产和任意风险资产的组合。

#### 3.2.2 Calculation of Expected Return of Portfolio

![](http://oam2zfeyb.bkt.clouddn.com/CFA-33.png)

We can find that if the investor accept the risk of 0 then he can only earn the yield of free risk rate.

### 3.3 Risk

[ Unsystematic risk ] :

- that can be eliminated by diversification 
- only take about 12 to 18 stocks in a portfolio to achieve 90% of the maximum diversification possible

*total risk = unsystematic risk + systematic risk*

### 3.4 Return generating model

- Multifactor models

![](http://oam2zfeyb.bkt.clouddn.com/CFA-35.png)

- Single-index model

![](http://oam2zfeyb.bkt.clouddn.com/CFA-37.png)

- Market model

### 3.5 Calculate And Interpret Beta

Beta is a standardized measure of the covariance of the asset's return with the  market return

#### 3.5.1 Security Charactertistic Line

![](http://oam2zfeyb.bkt.clouddn.com/CFA-41.png)

#### 3.5.2 Security Market Line

Actually it is the CAPM model

![](http://oam2zfeyb.bkt.clouddn.com/CFA-42.png)

[ Assumptions Of The CAPM ] :

- Risk aversion
- Utility maximizing investors
- Frictionless markets
- One-period horizon
- Homogeneous expections
- Divisible assets
- Competitive markets

#### 3.5.3 Identifying Mispriced Securities

```python
if EstimatedReturn > SML :
    return "UnderValued"
else:
    return "OverValued"
	
```

------

### 3.6 Evaluating the Performance Of The Portfolio

#### 3.6.1

- Sharp Ratio
- M-squared

#### 3.6.2 Based on systematic risk

- Treynor measure
- Jensen's alpha
