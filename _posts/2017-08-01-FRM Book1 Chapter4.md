# FRM Book1:Chapter Ⅳ

## 1. Arbitrage Pricing Theory And Multifactor Models of Risk And Return

[ Differences between CAPM and APT ] :

The risk exposures in the APT are known as factor betas

while in CAPM is known as beta

[ For the exam ] : 

* be able to calculate expected returns using single-factor and multifactor models
* know how to construct the SML for a well-diversified portfolio using a single-factor model
* to explain the APT ,and know how to construct a portfolio to hedge exposure to multiple risk factors

**Law of One Price**: identical assets selling in different locations should be priced identically in the different locations.

The standardized measure of systematic risk is beta,stardardized into units of market risk,which is the risk of holding the market portfolio(often represented by the S&P 500 Index )

[ THE implication of the single-factor security market line ] : when no arbitrage oppurnities exist,all well-diversified portfolios must lie in the line.

### 1.1 Arbitrage Pricing Theory

 CAPM can be considered a special restrictive use of the APT in which there is only one risk factor( the market risk factor )
